Tool for automate the scraping to obtain large amounts of data from websites.

# What is web scraping ?
Web scraping is a method of extracting data from websites without having to manually input the data. Most of this data is in an unstructured format, but it is later converted into a more structured format for use in different applications. There are many different ways to extract data from websites. These include using online services, particular APIs or even creating your code for web scraping from scratch. Large websites, like Google and Twitter, often have a lot of user feedback and questions. There is an API that lets you access your data in a structured way. This is the best option, but some sites do not allow users to access large amounts of data in a structured way, and some sites are not very technically advanced When it comes to data scanning, web scraping is the best option to consider. Web scraping requires two pieces of equipment: a crawler and a scraper. A crawler is a computer program that moves around the web and collects data.
